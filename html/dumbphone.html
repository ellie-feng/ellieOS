            <h2>today i realised that my dumbphone did NOT cure my smartphone addiction</h2>

            <h3>acknowledging the problem</h3>
            <p>
                I started noticing how often I reached for my phone when I was bored, anxious, or uncomfortable. Reading *Digital Minimalism* made me realise that this wasn’t just a bad habit—this was behavioural addiction shaped by devices designed to keep us scrolling.
            </p>

            <h3>solution 1: the 'dumb' smartphone</h3>
            <p>
                I tried stripping my iPhone down to its bare essentials—no social media, no distractions, just calls, messages, and a few practical apps. It helped, but I still found myself opening Safari to access the web versions of the apps I deleted. My brain was still craving the dopamine.
            </p>

            <h3>solution 2: the dumbphone</h3>
            <p>
                So I went further. I bought a Nokia 3210 4G. Messaging was slower, everything required intention, and after a few days, I started feeling genuinely at peace. But the addiction didn’t vanish—I simply moved the scrolling to my laptop and iPad.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h3>solution 3: the decentralised approach</h3>
            <p>
                I separated all the things my phone used to do into individual devices: a dedicated music device, an old Canon Powershot camera, a Kobo ereader, etc. By removing capabilities from my phone, I removed opportunities to scroll.
            </p>

            <h3>you don't need a dumbphone to be a digital minimalist</h3>
            <p>
                Small steps help: delete non-essential apps, turn off notifications, switch to greyscale, and try analogue tools for everyday tasks.
            </p>

            <h3>reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This journey isn’t about replacing your phone—it’s about rebuilding your relationship with attention and intention. Progress isn’t linear, but resilience matters more than perfection.
